# my third JS project
This is my final project in the Foundations Course of Odin Academy. I started Foundations nearly two years ago and I did not know when I would finish it, or if I ever would. Coding wasn't part of my world. Not in my education, work, social circles or even my corner of the Internet. Opening the terminal and VS Code felt scary. I thought I had to memorise everything. 

But I kept going anyway because I really, really, really wanted to get to the finish line. And it took twenty fucking months but I did it. I did it.

There is still some more to go. This was only the Foundations course. But now I have proof that I can make it to the finish line. 

Please have fun using my little calculator. It took a lot of labour to get those numbers to compute. Thanks for stopping by!
